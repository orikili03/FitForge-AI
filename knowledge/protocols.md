# WOD Protocols — Coach Reference

Classification and stimulus intent for CrossFit protocols. Use for **analyzing** and **classifying** WODs from archives; do not randomly deliver WODs — use this knowledge to generate principled, stimulus-appropriate workouts.

## Protocol Definitions

| Protocol | Description | Generated | Typical Duration | Energy System |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **AMRAP** | As Many Rounds/Reps As Possible | ✅ | 8–25 min | Glycolytic / Aerobic |
| **FOR_TIME**| Rounds for Time (RFT) | ✅ | 5–30 min | Mixed |
| **EMOM** | Every Minute On the Minute | ✅ | 8–20 min | Mixed / Quality |
| **TABATA** | 20s work / 10s rest × 8 | ✅ | 4 min | Phosphagen |
| **DEATH_BY**| Ascending ladder each minute | ✅ | 8–15 min | Glycolytic |
| **21-15-9** | Descending rep sprint | ✅ | 5–12 min | Phosphagen–Glycolytic |
| **LADDER** | Continuous rep increment | ✅ | 10–25 min | Mixed |
| **CHIPPER** | Long list of tasks | ✅ | 15–45 min | Aerobic–Glycolytic |
| **INTERVAL**| Fixed work/rest windows | ✅ | 15–40 min | Aerobic / Power |
| **STRENGTH**| Finding 1RM or Heavy Sets | ✅ | 15–30 min | Strength |
| **REST_DAY**| Recovery / Education | ✅ | — | — |
| **OTHER**   | Modular / Varied | ✅ | Varies | Varies |

## Protocol → Stimulus Mapping

- **Sprint (<7 min)**: FOR_TIME, 21-15-9, TABATA — high power, low total volume.
- **Short metcon (7–20 min)**: AMRAP, EMOM, FOR_TIME — sustained effort, moderate volume.
- **Long aerobic (20+ min)**: AMRAP, CHIPPER, INTERVAL — pacing, higher total volume.
- **Strength bias**: STRENGTH_SINGLE, STRENGTH_SETS, or EMOM with heavy, low-rep work.
- **Skill**: EMOM or short AMRAP with technique focus; lower density.

## Rep Scheme Guidelines by Protocol

- **AMRAP**: Reps per round should allow 4–8+ rounds in the cap; avoid grinding singles.
- **FOR_TIME / 21-15-9**: Load and volume so target finish sits in intended time domain.
- **EMOM**: Work should fit in ~30–45 sec so rest is meaningful; heavy EMOM = fewer reps.
- **CHIPPER**: One-time rep ranges per movement; scale so athlete doesn’t blow up on one station.

## Key Rule

WODs are fetched and stored **to learn structure, scaling, and stimulus** — not to be randomly served. Generation must use this taxonomy to pick protocol and duration from **intended stimulus** (see stimulusEngine and methodology).
