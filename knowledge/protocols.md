# WOD Protocols — Coach Reference

Classification and stimulus intent for CrossFit protocols. Use for **analyzing** and **classifying** WODs from archives; do not randomly deliver WODs — use this knowledge to generate principled, stimulus-appropriate workouts.

## Protocol Definitions

| Protocol | Description | Typical Duration | Energy System | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| **AMRAP** | As Many Rounds/Reps As Possible in a time cap | 8–25 min | Glycolytic / aerobic (by length) | Sustained effort; pacing; volume under time. |
| **FOR_TIME** (RFT) | Complete prescribed work as fast as possible | 5–30 min | Phosphagen–glycolytic (short); glycolytic–aerobic (long) | Task-priority; clear finish line; benchmark retest. |
| **EMOM** | Every Minute On the Minute — fixed work, rest with remaining time | 8–20 min | Mixed; quality-focused | Skill under fatigue; built-in rest; pacing. |
| **TABATA** | 8 rounds of 20 sec work / 10 sec rest | 4 min | Phosphagen / glycolytic | Maximal effort; short, repeatable. |
| **Death By** | Ascending ladder each minute until failure | 8–15 min | Glycolytic | Pacing; mental toughness; clear failure point. |
| **21-15-9** | Descending rep scheme for 2–3 movements, for time | 5–12 min | Phosphagen–glycolytic | Sprint; classic benchmark structure (e.g. Fran). |
| **CHIPPER** | One pass through a long list of tasks; for time | 15–45 min | Aerobic–glycolytic | High volume; transitions; pacing. |
| **LADDER** | Ascending or descending reps per round (e.g. 1-2-3-4-5) | 10–25 min | Mixed | Variation in density; often for time. |
| **INTERVAL** | Fixed work window, fixed rest (e.g. every 5 min for 25 min) | 15–40 min | Aerobic / power | Repeatability; compare round times; "Interval Nancy". |
| **STRENGTH_SINGLE** | Find heavy 1RM or heavy singles | N/A (skill) | Strength | Max strength; technique. |
| **STRENGTH_SETS** | Prescribed sets × reps at load (e.g. 5×5, 3-3-3-1-1-1) | 15–30 min | Strength | Strength development; sub-maximal. |
| **REST_DAY** | No workout; recovery / education content | — | — | Recovery; programming balance. |

## Protocol → Stimulus Mapping

- **Sprint (<7 min)**: FOR_TIME, 21-15-9, TABATA — high power, low total volume.
- **Short metcon (7–20 min)**: AMRAP, EMOM, FOR_TIME — sustained effort, moderate volume.
- **Long aerobic (20+ min)**: AMRAP, CHIPPER, INTERVAL — pacing, higher total volume.
- **Strength bias**: STRENGTH_SINGLE, STRENGTH_SETS, or EMOM with heavy, low-rep work.
- **Skill**: EMOM or short AMRAP with technique focus; lower density.

## Rep Scheme Guidelines by Protocol

- **AMRAP**: Reps per round should allow 4–8+ rounds in the cap; avoid grinding singles.
- **FOR_TIME / 21-15-9**: Load and volume so target finish sits in intended time domain.
- **EMOM**: Work should fit in ~30–45 sec so rest is meaningful; heavy EMOM = fewer reps.
- **CHIPPER**: One-time rep ranges per movement; scale so athlete doesn’t blow up on one station.

## Key Rule

WODs are fetched and stored **to learn structure, scaling, and stimulus** — not to be randomly served. Generation must use this taxonomy to pick protocol and duration from **intended stimulus** (see stimulusEngine and methodology).
