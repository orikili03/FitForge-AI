# Scaling Principles

## Why Scale

Scaling preserves the intended stimulus of a workout while adjusting for an athlete's current ability. A properly scaled workout should elicit the same physiological response and effort level as the prescribed version, just at a level appropriate for the athlete.

Scaling is not a lesser version of the workout — it is the correct version for that athlete.

## When to Scale

- The athlete cannot perform the prescribed movement safely.
- The prescribed load would slow the athlete to the point of missing the time domain.
- The volume would cause form breakdown before the workout is complete.
- The athlete has an injury or limitation that contraindicates a movement.

## Scaling Methods

### 1. Reduce Load

The most common scaling method. Reduce barbell, dumbbell, or kettlebell weight so the athlete can:
- Maintain proper mechanics throughout the workout.
- Complete sets in the intended rep ranges (e.g., unbroken or in 2–3 sets).
- Finish within the target time domain.

**Guidelines by level**:
- Beginner: 40–50% of prescribed Rx weight.
- Intermediate: 65–80% of prescribed Rx weight.
- Advanced: Rx or slightly above.

### 2. Modify the Movement

Substitute a simpler variation that trains the same pattern:

| Rx Movement | Scaling Options |
|------------|----------------|
| Pull-up | Ring rows, banded pull-ups, jumping pull-ups |
| Push-up | Elevated push-ups (hands on box), knee push-ups |
| Air squat | Box squat, reduce depth |
| Burpee | Step-back burpee, no push-up burpee |
| Deadlift | Kettlebell deadlift, lighter barbell |
| Front squat | Goblet squat, air squat |
| Push press | Strict press, dumbbell press |
| Power clean | Hang clean, dumbbell clean |
| Double-under | Single-unders (2:1 ratio) |
| Row | Bike or run for equivalent time |
| Run | Bike or row substitute, walk/jog |

### 3. Reduce Volume

Lower the number of reps, rounds, or distance:
- Reduce reps by 30–50% for beginners.
- Reduce rounds (e.g., 3 rounds instead of 5).
- Reduce distances (e.g., 200m run instead of 400m).

### 4. Adjust Time Domain

- Add a time cap to open-ended workouts so athletes don't grind for excessive time.
- Extend rest intervals in EMOM or interval formats.
- Reduce AMRAP duration for beginners (e.g., 8 min instead of 12).

### 5. Reduce Complexity

For high-skill movements:
- Break the movement into components (e.g., strict pull-ups instead of kipping).
- Use partial range of motion progressions.
- Add tempo or pauses to build positional strength.

## Scaling by Fitness Level

### Beginner (0–6 months of training)
- Bodyweight or very light loads only.
- Simple movement patterns (no Olympic lifts at speed).
- Shorter time domains (8–12 min).
- Focus on mechanics and consistency.
- Lower total volume (fewer reps and rounds).

### Intermediate (6–18 months)
- Moderate loads (60–80% Rx).
- Can perform kipping movements with control.
- Medium time domains (12–20 min).
- Beginning to push intensity with good mechanics.
- Standard volume with minor reductions where needed.

### Advanced (18+ months)
- Rx or Rx+ loads.
- Full movement library including Olympic lifts and gymnastics skills.
- All time domains.
- High intensity with consistent mechanics.
- Full prescribed volume.

## Injury Scaling

When an athlete has an injury or limitation:
- Identify the affected movement pattern (e.g., shoulder = push/pull overhead).
- Substitute a movement that trains a similar stimulus without aggravating the injury.
- Reduce load on any movement that involves the affected area.
- When in doubt, remove the movement and replace with a safe alternative.

Common substitutions for injuries:
- **Shoulder**: Replace overhead pressing with floor press; replace pull-ups with ring rows; reduce overhead volume.
- **Knee**: Replace running with rowing or biking; reduce squat depth; avoid box jumps.
- **Lower back**: Avoid heavy hinges; replace deadlifts with hip bridges or lighter kettlebell work; use belt squats.
- **Wrist**: Use dumbbells instead of barbell; avoid front rack position; modify push-up hand position.

## Key Principle

The scaled version should allow the athlete to finish the workout in the same relative time domain as the Rx version, with the same relative effort. If the Rx version is a 6-minute sprint, the scaled version should also be a 6-minute sprint — not a 15-minute grind.
