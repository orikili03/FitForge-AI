# Movement Catalog & Coach Cues

## Universal Priorities

1. **Mechanics** — Learn the movement correctly.
2. **Consistency** — Reliable under fatigue.
3. **Intensity** — Only then add load, speed, or volume.

## Strength / Weightlifting Movements

### Deadlift
- **Domain**: Strength (Weightlifting)
- **Patterns**: Hinge
- **Equipment**: Barbell + plates (or kettlebell / dumbbell variant)
- **Description**: Lift a loaded barbell from the floor to standing by driving through the legs and extending the hips. Posterior chain dominant.
- **Setup**: Bar over mid-foot; hinge at hip; neutral spine; shoulders slightly in front of bar.
- **Cues**: "Push the floor away"; "Bar close to body"; "Hips and shoulders rise together."
- **Common faults**: Rounded back, hips rising before chest, bar drifting from body.
- **Scaling**: Reduce load 30–50%, kettlebell or dumbbell deadlift, sumo stance for mobility limitations.
- **Suggested loads**: Beginner 40kg, Intermediate 60kg, Advanced 80–100kg+
- **Stimulus role**: Heavy hinge pattern; builds posterior chain strength. In metcons, moderate load for moderate reps (10–15).

### Front Squat
- **Domain**: Strength (Weightlifting)
- **Patterns**: Squat
- **Equipment**: Barbell + plates + rack
- **Description**: Squat with barbell in front rack position. Demands upright torso, thoracic mobility, and quad/core strength.
- **Setup**: Elbows high; bar in front rack; torso upright.
- **Cues**: "Elbows up"; "Chest up"; "Knees out."
- **Common faults**: Elbows dropping, forward lean, loss of midline stability.
- **Scaling**: Reduce load, goblet squat (dumbbell/kettlebell), box squat for depth issues.
- **Suggested loads**: Beginner 20–30kg, Intermediate 40kg, Advanced 60–80kg+
- **Stimulus role**: Quad and core dominant squat. In metcons, lighter loads for higher reps.

### Push Press
- **Domain**: Strength (Weightlifting)
- **Patterns**: Push (vertical)
- **Equipment**: Barbell (or dumbbells)
- **Description**: Use a dip-drive to press a barbell from shoulders to overhead. Combines lower body power with pressing strength.
- **Cues**: "Dip and drive"; "Finish with legs"; "Lock out overhead."
- **Common faults**: Pressing before hip extension completes, excessive back arch.
- **Scaling**: Reduce load, strict press, dumbbell press.
- **Suggested loads**: Beginner 20–30kg, Intermediate 40kg, Advanced 50–60kg+
- **Stimulus role**: Shoulder and overhead power. Efficient way to move load overhead in metcons.

### Power Clean
- **Domain**: Strength (Weightlifting)
- **Patterns**: Hinge, Pull
- **Equipment**: Barbell + plates (+ rack for returning)
- **Description**: Explosive hip extension to pull barbell from floor (or hang) to front rack. High-skill, high-power movement.
- **Cues**: "Jump and shrug"; "Fast elbows"; "Receive in front rack."
- **Common faults**: Early arm pull, poor hip extension, slow turnover.
- **Scaling**: Reduce load, hang power clean, dumbbell clean. Do not program high reps at heavy load.
- **Suggested loads**: Beginner 20–30kg, Intermediate 40kg, Advanced 60kg+
- **Stimulus role**: Full-body power. In metcons, typically moderate load, lower reps (3–7 per round).

## Gymnastics / Bodyweight Movements

### Pull-up
- **Domain**: Gymnastics
- **Patterns**: Pull (vertical)
- **Equipment**: Pull-up bar (or rings)
- **Description**: Hang from a bar and pull chin above bar level. Strict or kipping variants.
- **Cues**: "Full hang to chin over bar"; "Drive elbows back."
- **Common faults**: Incomplete ROM, overuse of kipping without strict base.
- **Scaling**: Ring rows, banded pull-ups, jumping pull-ups.
- **Stimulus role**: Upper body pulling. High reps in metcons (10–20+). Pairs well with pushing movements.

### Push-up
- **Domain**: Gymnastics
- **Patterns**: Push (horizontal)
- **Equipment**: None (mat optional)
- **Description**: Lower body to floor from plank, press back up with full arm extension. Chest, triceps, core.
- **Cues**: "Chest and thighs touch floor"; "Full lockout."
- **Common faults**: Sagging hips, incomplete range of motion.
- **Scaling**: Elevated push-ups (hands on box), knee push-ups, wall push-ups.
- **Stimulus role**: Foundational pushing. High reps possible (15–30+). Core stability under fatigue.

### Air Squat
- **Domain**: Gymnastics
- **Patterns**: Squat
- **Equipment**: None
- **Description**: Bodyweight squat below parallel with arms forward for balance. Hip crease below knee.
- **Cues**: "Hip crease below knee"; "Weight in heels"; "Knees out."
- **Common faults**: Knees caving, heels rising, not reaching depth.
- **Scaling**: Reduce depth, box squat, assisted squat (holding rig post).
- **Stimulus role**: High-volume leg endurance. Often in metcons at 15–50 reps per round.

### Burpee
- **Domain**: Gymnastics
- **Patterns**: Push, Hinge, Locomotion
- **Equipment**: None
- **Description**: Drop to floor (chest/thighs contact), push up, jump and clap overhead. Full-body conditioning movement.
- **Cues**: "Chest and thighs touch floor"; "Full hip extension on jump."
- **Common faults**: Not reaching full hip extension on the jump, incomplete chest-to-floor.
- **Scaling**: Step-back burpee, no push-up burpee, box step-over.
- **Stimulus role**: High metabolic cost, full-body. Elevates heart rate rapidly. Pairs with any modality. Moderate reps in metcons (7–15 per round).

## Monostructural / Cardio Movements

### Row (Ergometer)
- **Domain**: Monostructural
- **Patterns**: Pull, Locomotion
- **Equipment**: Rower
- **Description**: Full-body pulling on a rowing ergometer. Legs-hips-arms sequence. Low impact.
- **Cues**: "Legs–hips–arms"; "Smooth recovery."
- **Scaling**: Reduce pace, shorter intervals, bike or ski erg substitute.
- **Stimulus role**: Cardio and pulling endurance. Distances: 200–500m (sprint), 1000m+ (pacing). Calorie-based (12–20 cal) in metcons.

### Assault Bike (Air Bike)
- **Domain**: Monostructural
- **Patterns**: Locomotion
- **Equipment**: Assault bike / echo bike
- **Description**: Arms and legs drive a fan-resistance bike. Extremely high metabolic demand.
- **Cues**: "Push and pull"; "Controlled RPM."
- **Scaling**: Lower RPM, shorter intervals, row or run substitute.
- **Stimulus role**: Full-body cardio. Very high heart rate stimulus. Typically 10–30 cal or 30–90 sec efforts in metcons.

### Run
- **Domain**: Monostructural
- **Patterns**: Locomotion
- **Equipment**: None (outdoor space or treadmill)
- **Description**: Running at prescribed distance or duration. Most natural human locomotive pattern.
- **Cues**: "Mid-foot strike"; "Tall posture."
- **Scaling**: Bike/row substitute, reduce distance, walk/jog.
- **Stimulus role**: Cardio endurance and mental toughness. Distances: 200m (sprint) to 800m+ (pacing). Pairs well with strength or gymnastics for classic couplets.

### Double-Under
- **Domain**: Monostructural
- **Patterns**: Locomotion
- **Equipment**: Jump rope
- **Description**: Jump rope passes under feet twice per jump. High-skill coordination movement.
- **Cues**: "Wrists"; "Jump height"; "Relax shoulders."
- **Common faults**: Donkey kicking, excessive arm swing, tension in shoulders.
- **Scaling**: Single-unders (2:1 or 3:1 ratio), line hops, bike/row for equivalent time.
- **Stimulus role**: Coordination and cardio. Typically 30–60 reps in metcons. Elevated heart rate with low muscular fatigue.

## Movement Pairing Guidelines
- **Push + Pull**: Balanced upper body (e.g., push press + pull-ups).
- **Upper + Lower**: Spread fatigue (e.g., push-ups + air squats).
- **Strength + Monostructural**: Classic CrossFit couplet (e.g., deadlifts + row).
- **Gymnastics + Monostructural**: High-rep conditioning (e.g., burpees + run).
- Avoid pairing two movements with the same dominant pattern in a couplet (e.g., deadlift + power clean = double hinge overload).
- In triplets, aim for three different primary patterns (e.g., squat + pull + locomotion).
