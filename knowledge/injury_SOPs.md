# Injury Scaling SOPs

This document contains explicit rules and "if/then" logic for modifying workouts around common injuries and limitations. The goal is to keep the athlete moving, preserve the original metabolic stimulus of the WOD, and avoid aggravating the affected area.

## General Principles
- **If** a movement causes sharp pain, **then** stop immediately and select an alternate movement.
- **If** there is a unilateral injury (e.g., left shoulder), **then** it is acceptable to perform unilateral work on the healthy side (e.g., single-arm dumbbell push press on the right).
- **If** the injury severely impacts the intended stimulus (e.g., sprained ankle during a sprint workout), **then** redesign the workout completely using available safe movements (e.g., Assault bike sprints).

## 1. Shoulder Limitations (Impingement, Rotator Cuff, AC Joint)
Athletes with shoulder issues typically struggle with overhead pressing, pulling from an overhead position, and sometimes receiving barbells in the front rack.

- **IF** the WOD includes an **Off-the-Floor Overhead Lift (Snatch)**
  - **THEN** substitute with a heavy pull (e.g., Clean Pull, Deadlift), or Single-Arm Dumbbell Snatch on the healthy side, or Kettlebell Swings (eye level).
- **IF** the WOD includes an **Overhead Press (Shoulder Press, Push Press, Jerk)**
  - **THEN** substitute with Floor Press, Landmine Press (if tolerated), or strict push-ups (if pain-free). Ensure eccentric motion is controlled.
- **IF** the WOD includes **Overhead Pulling (Pull-ups, Muscle-ups, Toes-to-Bar)**
  - **THEN** substitute with Ring Rows (adjusting foot position to manage load), horizontal pulls (bent-over rows), or strict knee raises substituting for toes-to-bar.
- **IF** the WOD includes **Front Rack Movements (Front Squat, Clean)**
  - **THEN** substitute with a Cross-arm Front Squat grip, Zombie Squats, Back Squats, or Dumbbell/Kettlebell variants if the barbell position causes pain.

## 2. Lower Back Pain (Lumbar Strain, Disc Issues)
Lower back pain is often triggered by heavy hinging, rounding the spine under load, and high-impact movements.

- **IF** the WOD includes Heavy **Deadlifts or Hinging (Kettlebell Swings)**
  - **THEN** substitute with Glute Bridges / Hip Thrusts, light Kettlebell Deadlifts (elevated off blocks to limit ROM), or Belt Squats. Avoid heavy spinal loading.
- **IF** the WOD includes **Spinal Flexion (GHD Sit-ups, high volume Sit-ups)**
  - **THEN** substitute with anti-extension core work: Plank holds, Palloff Presses, or hollow rocks (if tolerated).
- **IF** the WOD includes **High-Impact Weightlifting (Cleans, Snatches)**
  - **THEN** scale down the weight significantly and focus on perfect mechanics, or substitute with controlled, slow-tempo squats or presses.
- **IF** the WOD includes **Rowing or Biking**
  - **THEN** use the Assault Bike primarily. If rowing, reduce the stroke length to avoid extreme lumbar flexion at the catch.

## 3. Knee Pain (Patellar Tendonitis, Meniscus)
Knee issues often present during deep flexion (squatting below parallel) or high-impact bounding (box jumps, running).

- **IF** the WOD includes **Deep Squatting (Pistols, Wall Balls, Front/Back Squats)**
  - **THEN** limit the range of motion (ROM) to pain-free depth using a **Box Squat**. For wall balls, use a lighter medicine ball and squat only to the box.
- **IF** the WOD includes **High-Impact Bounding (Box Jumps, Double Unders)**
  - **THEN** substitute with Box Step-ups (low box), or heavy sled pushes. For double unders, substitute with the Assault Bike (calories).
- **IF** the WOD includes **Running**
  - **THEN** substitute with Rowing or Assault Bike. The Assault bike limits knee flexion and removes the eccentric impact of running.
- **IF** the WOD includes **Olympic Lifts ending in a Squat (Squat Clean, Squat Snatch)**
  - **THEN** substitute with Power variants (Power Clean, Power Snatch) and catch high to avoid deep knee flexion.

## 4. Wrist Mobility / Pain
Wrist pain makes the front rack position, overhead supporting, and pushing off the floor very uncomfortable.

- **IF** the WOD includes **Front Rack (Cleans, Front Squats, Thrusters)**
  - **THEN** use Dumbbells (neutral grip). For Front Squats, use the cross-arm grip with the barbell, or Zombie Squats.
- **IF** the WOD includes **Pressing from the Floor (Push-ups, Burpees)**
  - **THEN** use parallettes, hex dumbbells, or fist push-ups to maintain a neutral (straight) wrist.
- **IF** the WOD includes **Overhead Supporting (Overhead Squats, Jerks)**
  - **THEN** use Dumbbells, or alter the stimulus to a back squat if it's a leg strength day.
- **IF** the WOD includes **Rowing**
  - **THEN** relax the grip completely on the recovery. If pull causes pain, substitute with a bike.
