# CrossFit Methodology

## Definition

CrossFit is constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity. This three-part definition captures the core of the methodology and must inform every workout programmed.

## Functional Movements

Functional movements are natural, compound, multi-joint actions that move large loads over long distances quickly. They are universal motor recruitment patterns found in everyday life and sport. Key characteristics:

- They are compound (multi-joint, multi-muscle).
- They move the body or external objects from core to extremity.
- They are irreducible — they cannot be simplified without losing function.
- Examples: squat, deadlift, press, clean, snatch, pull-up, row, run.

## Constantly Varied

Programming must be broad, general, and inclusive. Routine is the enemy. Workouts should vary across:

- **Modalities**: Gymnastics (bodyweight), Weightlifting (external load), Monostructural (cardio/metabolic conditioning).
- **Time domains**: Short (<7 min sprint), Medium (7–20 min sustained), Long (20+ min aerobic pacing).
- **Movement patterns**: Push, Pull, Squat, Hinge, Core, Locomotion, Carry.
- **Load and rep schemes**: Heavy singles to light high-rep sets.
- **Protocols**: AMRAP, EMOM, For Time, Tabata, intervals, task-priority, time-priority.

Variation must be systematic, not random. A good program ensures balanced exposure across all modalities, patterns, and time domains over a training week.

## Intensity

Intensity is the independent variable most commonly associated with maximizing the rate of return on favorable adaptation. In CrossFit terms, intensity equals power: force times distance divided by time.

Intensity is relative to the individual. A beginner at high relative intensity looks different from an advanced athlete at high relative intensity. The coach must scale load, volume, and complexity to maintain the intended stimulus for each athlete.

### Intensity Guidelines

- Mechanics first, then consistency, then intensity.
- Never sacrifice form for speed or load.
- Scale to maintain the intended stimulus (time domain, rep scheme, effort level).
- High intensity should be earned through demonstrated mechanical proficiency.

## The 10 General Physical Skills

A well-rounded program develops all ten:

1. Cardiovascular/Respiratory Endurance
2. Stamina
3. Strength
4. Flexibility
5. Power
6. Speed
7. Coordination
8. Agility
9. Balance
10. Accuracy

## Three Modalities

Every workout should draw from one or more:

1. **Gymnastics (G)**: Bodyweight movements — pull-ups, push-ups, air squats, handstand push-ups, muscle-ups, toes-to-bar, burpees. Develops body control, relative strength, coordination.
2. **Weightlifting (W)**: Movements with external load — deadlift, clean, snatch, squat, press, thruster. Develops absolute strength, power, force production.
3. **Monostructural (M)**: Single-modality cardio — running, rowing, biking, swimming, jump rope. Develops cardiovascular endurance, stamina.

### Couplets and Triplets

- **Couplet**: Two movements (e.g., thrusters + pull-ups = "Fran").
- **Triplet**: Three movements (e.g., row + wall ball + box jump).
- Classic CrossFit WODs typically use 2–3 movements. More than 4 movements in a single WOD is uncommon and usually reserved for chippers.

## Workout Structure

A typical class follows:

1. **Warm-up** (5–10 min): General movement prep, specific mobility for the day's movements.
2. **Skill/Strength** (10–20 min): Focused work on a lift or skill.
3. **WOD** (10–20 min): The conditioning piece — the metabolic challenge.
4. **Cool-down** (5–10 min): Stretching, recovery, mobility.

## Time Domains and Stimulus

- **Short (<7 min)**: Sprint effort, near-maximal intensity, powerful movements, low total volume. Example: "Fran" (21-15-9 thrusters and pull-ups).
- **Medium (7–20 min)**: Sustained effort, moderate-to-high intensity, balanced volume. Example: "Helen" (3 rounds of 400m run, 21 KB swings, 12 pull-ups).
- **Long (20+ min)**: Aerobic pacing, moderate intensity, higher total volume. Example: "Murph" (1 mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 air squats, 1 mile run).

The intended stimulus should be clearly communicated: what time domain, what effort level, what the athlete should feel during and after.

## Programming Principles

- **Balance modalities**: Over a week, hit G, W, and M roughly equally.
- **Balance patterns**: Rotate push/pull/squat/hinge/core/locomotion. Avoid consecutive days of the same dominant pattern.
- **Manage volume**: Total weekly volume should support adaptation without overtraining. Heavy strength days should be followed by lighter or skill-focused days.
- **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase load, volume, or complexity over weeks.
- **Recovery**: Include rest days (typically 3 on / 1 off or 5 on / 2 off). Fatigue should be managed — if an athlete is showing signs of accumulated fatigue, reduce intensity or volume.
- **Benchmark and retest**: Use benchmark WODs periodically to measure progress.

## Safety and Coaching Priorities

1. Mechanics — learn the movement correctly.
2. Consistency — demonstrate the movement reliably under fatigue.
3. Intensity — only then increase speed, load, or volume.

Never program movements an athlete cannot perform safely. Always provide scaling options.
