# CrossFit Workout Examples

Curated examples across time domains, modalities, and protocols. Use these as structural templates — not to copy verbatim, but to understand how movements, reps, and time domains compose into coherent workouts with clear stimulus.

**Modalities**: W + G + M
**Patterns**: Hinge/Pull + Push + Locomotion

## Strength-Bias Workouts

### Heavy Day — Strength Focus
On a 15-minute clock:
Find a heavy single Deadlift.

Then: 5x3 Deadlift at 70% of today's heavy single. Rest 90 sec between sets.

**Stimulus**: Pure strength development. Quality reps, full recovery between sets.
**Modalities**: W
**Patterns**: Hinge

### Strength + Conditioning
Part A (12 min): Build to a heavy set of 3 Front Squats.

Part B: 3 rounds for time:
- 10 Front Squats (50% of Part A weight)
- 15 cal Row

**Stimulus**: Strength first, then apply it under fatigue. Conditioning piece should feel fast. Target Part B: 6–8 minutes.
**Modalities**: W, then W + M
**Patterns**: Squat, then Squat + Locomotion

## Skill-Focus Workouts

### Skill EMOM
EMOM 12 minutes:
- Odd: 5 Strict Pull-ups (or banded)

## Protocol Reference

| Protocol | Description | Typical Duration |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| AMRAP | As Many Rounds/Reps As Possible in a time cap | 8–25 min |
| EMOM | Every Minute On the Minute — fixed work, rest with remaining time | 8–20 min |
| For Time | Complete prescribed work as fast as possible | 5–30 min |
| Tabata | 8 rounds of 20 sec work / 10 sec rest | 4 min |
| 21-15-9 | Descending rep scheme for 2–3 movements, for time | 5–12 min |
| Death By | Ascending ladder each minute until failure | 8–15 min |

## Rep Scheme Guidelines

- **Sprint** (<7 min): Lower total reps, higher per-rep intensity. E.g., 21-15-9 or 3 rounds of 5-8 reps.
- **Medium** (7–20 min): Moderate reps per round. E.g., 10-15 reps per movement, 4–6 rounds.
- **Long** (20+ min): Higher total volume, lower per-round intensity. E.g., 5-12 reps per movement, 5–8+ rounds.

## Load Guidelines

- Metcon loads should allow the athlete to complete prescribed reps in 1–3 sets (not grinding singles).
- Strength work: 70–90% of 1RM for working sets.
- If load slows the athlete out of the intended time domain, it is too heavy.
